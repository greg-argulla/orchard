## Technologies

- Tailwind - really great for rapid development when it comes to styling components.
- Reactjs - One of the popular frontend frameworks in the market and one I am most comfortable using with.
- Shadcn - Radix UI's plug and play components that looks good and you can install per component instead of a whole library (I used the dialog here)
- Vitejs - The fastest dev and build runtime as far as I experienced. List of advantages and why one should use it is indicated here: https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html
